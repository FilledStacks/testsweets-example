# TestSweets example

This application serves as the example for you to test our and work on TestSweets if you don't have a project to work on. The `master` branch has the empty project in it and will always be the clean starting project.

To see an example of how it looks the branch `guide/01-get-started` has the code from the first testsweets tutorial which you can see here[[[[[Add the written get started guide here]]]]]
